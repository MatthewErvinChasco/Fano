*makeQuaternions.mlx*:
This code generates unit quaternions in terms of the Dirac matrices.

*makeOctonions.mlx*:
This code generates unit octonions in terms of the Dirac matrices, in the Cayley-Dickson construction.

*quaternionProduct.mlx*:
This code computes the direct product of two quaternions. This also gives the dot product and cross product between the 3D components of the vectors.

*octonionProduct.mlx*:
This code computes the direct product of two octonions. This also gives the dot product and cross product between the 7D components of the vectors.

This code contains functions that use the MATLAB® Symbolic Math Toolbox™. The file *Example.mlx* is provided as a guide of use.
